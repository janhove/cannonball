#' @title Walkthrough blocking on a covariate
#'
#' @description This function produces a step-by-step demonstration
#'              of how researchers can 'block' on a continuous covariate
#'              and how they can analyse the data of a randomised block design.
#' @param n The number of data points per group.
#' @param diff The boost that participants in the intervention group receive.
#' @param sd The standard deviation of the normal distributions from which the data are drawn.
#' @param rho The correlation between the covariate and the outcome (pre-intervention) in the population.
#' @param showdata Do you want to output a dataframe containing the plotted data (\code{TRUE})
#'                 or not (\code{FALSE}, default)?
#' @param pedant Do you want to run the significance test in pedant mode (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}, default)? See Details.
#' @keywords significance test, p-value, blocking, control variable
#' @details Data are generated from a normal distribution with the requested
#' standard deviation; a covariate is also generated. The data points are then
#' grouped in pairs based on their covariate scores. Within each pair, the data points
#' are then randomly assigned to the control or intervention group.
#' Data points in the intervention group receive a boost
#' as specified by 'diff'. Finally, a significance test is ran on the data.
#'
#' By default, the significance test is a two-sample Student's t-test.
#' Technically, the p-value from this test is the probability
#' that a t-statistic larger than the one observed
#' would've been observed if only chance were at play, but
#' the walkthrough text says that is the probability that
#' a mean difference larger than the one observed would've
#' been observed if only chance were at play. That is,
#' I use the t-test as an
#' approximation to a permutation test.
#' Switch on pedant mode if you want to run a permutation test.
