\usage{
walkthrough_p(n = 10, diff = 0, sd = 1, showdata = FALSE, pedant = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of data points per group.}

\item{diff}{The boost that participants in the intervention group receive.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the normal distributions from which the data are drawn.}

\item{showdata}{Do you want to output a dataframe containing the plotted data (\code{TRUE})
or not (\code{FALSE}, default)?}

\item{pedant}{Do you want to run the significance test in pedant mode (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}, default)? See Details.}
}
\description{
This function produces a step-by-step demonstration
             of a significance test for a two-group comparison.
}
\details{
Data are generated from a normal distribution with the requested
standard deviation. Then, the data points are randomly assigned to two
equal-sized groups. Data points in the intervention group receive a boost
as specified by \code{diff}. Finally, a significance test is run on the data.

By default, the significance test is a two-sample Student's t-test.
Technically, the p-value from this test is the probability
that a t-statistic larger than the one observed
would've been observed if only chance were at play, but
the walkthrough text says that is the probability that
a mean difference larger than the one observed would've
been observed if only chance were at play. That is,
I use the t-test as an
approximation to a permutation test.
Switch on pedant mode if you want to run a permutation test.
